Templates for TeXworks
============
A script to insert often used snippets of (La)TeX in TexWorks.

Inspired by "context aware autocomplete" by @henrikmidtiby

Current status: **v0.1 - Not polished but working as intended** 

##Prerequistes
TeXworks editor. Bundled with [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) or downloadable from its [homepage](http://www.tug.org/texworks/).

##Install
Just copy the files (templates.txt, insertTemplate.js and openTemplateFile.js (optional)) or the entire "templates" directory to your texworks script directory. This can be accessed from the menu in TeXworks: Scripts > Scripting TeXworks > Show Scripts Folder.
Reload scripts or restart TeXworks afterwards.

##Usage
Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+T or the menu item "Insert template" gives you a list of templates to choose from. When you select one it is inserted af the current point in your active file. 

To add, edit or remove templates use the "Open template file" menu item, or edit the file directly using your editor of choice.
